# Tomcat

This is a simple Tomcat project that simulate the very basic operation of EC site.
I created it for learn Tomcat and basic of java web application.
It allows user registration&login, add/remove goods to/from shopping cart and check shopping cart content.
For a learning purpose, I avoided using thrid party packages. (Except mysql drive of course)

Here are its main pages.
